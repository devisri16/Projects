HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION USING MNIST DATASET

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the MNIST dataset and preprocesses the images for training and testing.
2. Constructs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit classification using TensorFlow-Keras.
3. Compiles and trains the model on the MNIST dataset, evaluating its performance.
4. Saves the trained model to a file named "MNIST_10_epochs.h5."
5. Loads the saved model and creates a drawing interface for users to draw digits using OpenCV.
6. Recognizes the drawn digit and displays the prediction on the drawing interface.
7. Press "Enter" to recognize the drawn digit, "ESC" to exit the drawing interface, and "c" to clear the drawing.
8. The CNN model achieves certain accuracy and loss results, which are plotted and displayed.
9. The model is saved, and the drawing interface allows users to interactively test the digit recognition capabilities.
10. The code combines image processing, machine learning, and user interface elements to enable handwritten digit recognition through drawing.

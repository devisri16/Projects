STOCK MARKET PREDICTION 

This code performs stock market price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks:

1. It loads historical stock price data from a CSV file and preprocesses the data by scaling it using MinMaxScaler.
2. The data is divided into training and testing sets, and sequences of stock prices are created with a given window size.
3. A sequential LSTM model is constructed with two LSTM layers and a dense output layer.
4. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
5. The LSTM model is trained on the training sequences for a specified number of epochs and batch size.
6. The model predicts stock prices for the test sequences.
7. The predicted prices are inverse-transformed to their original scale.
8. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated between the predicted and actual prices for evaluation.
9. The predicted and actual stock prices are plotted to visualize the model's performance.
10. The code combines data preprocessing, LSTM modeling, training, evaluation, and plotting to predict stock prices.
